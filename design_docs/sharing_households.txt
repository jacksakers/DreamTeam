Design Document: Step 4 (Simplified) - Household Sharing & Management
This document outlines a simplified, client-only approach for sharing, joining, 
and managing households using a direct link. This method prioritizes 
ease of implementation and is suitable for applications where top-tier 
security is not a primary concern.

1. Feature Overview üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶
This feature introduces a "Manage Households" modal for all household-related tasks. 
Users can generate a direct invitation link to share with another person. The 
security of this process is enforced entirely by Firestore Security Rules, which 
will be crafted to allow specific actions like joining or leaving a household.

Core Functionality:

Generate a simple, shareable link containing the household's ID.

A new page to handle joining via this link.

A central modal for managing household membership and switching between households.

Technical Approach:

Client-Side Logic: All actions are initiated from the user's browser.

Direct Linking: The URL will contain the household ID (e.g., .../join/householdId_abc123).

Firestore Rules: Smartly written security rules will serve as the "backend logic" to 
authorize valid actions.

2. User Flow & UI
The user interface and flow remain the same as the more complex version:

Accessing the Modal: A "Manage Household" button on the dashboard opens a modal.

The "Manage Household" Modal:

Current Household: Displays the active household's name and its members.

Share: A button that generates a direct link (https://your-app-url.com/join/householdId_abc123) and provides a "Copy" button.

My Households: A list of all households the user belongs to. The user can click 
one to make it their active household or click a "Leave" button to exit.

The Joining Process:

A new user (User B) clicks the invitation link.

They are taken to a "Join Household" page. If not logged in, they are prompted to do so.

After authenticating, they see a message: "You've been invited to join 'The Smiths' Home'. Accept?"

Clicking "Accept" triggers a client-side function that adds them to the household in Firestore. They are then redirected to the dashboard.

3. Technical Architecture (Client-Side)
The process is straightforward and relies on direct Firestore updates from the user's browser.

Generating the Link: When a user clicks "Share," the app gets the activeHouseholdId from its global state and constructs the full URL.

Handling the Join Page: The JoinPage.jsx component at the route /join/:householdId will:

Extract the householdId from the URL parameters.

Fetch the household's public data (like its name) to display to the user.

Upon the user clicking "Accept," it will perform two Firestore update operations:

Update the Household: Adds the current user's UID to the members array of the households/{householdId} document.

Update the User Profile: Adds the householdId to the householdIds array of the users/{userId} document.

Leaving a Household: When a user clicks "Leave," a similar client-side function runs, removing the respective IDs from the household and user documents.

4. Firestore Data Models
The data models are simplified, as the invites collection is no longer needed.

JSON

// To store user-specific, non-auth data
"users": {
  "userUid_A": {
    "email": "userA@example.com",
    "displayName": "Alice",
    "householdIds": ["householdId_123", "householdId_456"]
  }
}

// The household document itself
"households": {
  "householdId_123": {
    "name": "The Smiths' Home",
    // This array is now updated directly by the client
    "members": ["userUid_A", "userUid_B"]
  }
}
5. Component Architecture
src/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ features/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ household/
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ManageHouseholdModal.jsx    // The main modal component.
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ HouseholdSelector.jsx       // Sub-component for switching households.
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ householdApi.js             // Firestore update functions (e.g., joinHousehold).
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ pages/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ JoinPage.jsx                    // Page for handling /join/:householdId route.
6. Firestore Security Rules (The New "Backend")
This is the most critical part of the simplified architecture. The rules must be permissive enough to allow joining/leaving but restrictive enough to prevent abuse.

rules_version = '2';

service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {

    // Function to check if a user is already a member of a household
    function isHouseholdMember(householdId) {
      return request.auth != null && get(/databases/$(database)/documents/households/$(householdId)).data.members.has(request.auth.uid);
    }

    // Rules for user profiles
    match /users/{userId} {
      // A user can read/write their own document
      allow read, write: if request.auth.uid == userId;
    }

    // Rules for the households collection
    match /households/{householdId} {
      // Allow any authenticated user to read a household's info (e.g., its name for the join page)
      allow read: if request.auth != null;

      // Allow updates under specific conditions
      allow update: if
        // Condition 1: User is already a member (allows them to change the name or leave)
        isHouseholdMember(householdId) ||
        // Condition 2: User is adding THEMSELVES to a household they are not yet in.
        (
          !isHouseholdMember(householdId) &&
          request.resource.data.members == resource.data.members.concat([request.auth.uid])
        );

      // Creating new households should be handled by a dedicated function in your app
      allow create: if request.auth.uid in request.resource.data.members;
    }

    // ... (existing rules for shoppingLists, events, etc., which rely on isHouseholdMember, remain the same)
  }
}
Rule Explanation:

allow read: Anyone who is logged in can read a household's data. This is necessary so the "Join" page can display the household's name before the user joins.

allow update: An update is permitted if either of two conditions is met:

The user is already a member. This lets them perform actions like renaming the household or removing themselves from the members array.

The user is joining. The rule cleverly checks that the new list of members is exactly the old list of members plus the current user's ID. This prevents a user from adding other people or removing anyone during the join process.

7. Action Plan ‚öôÔ∏è
Update Security Rules: Replace your existing firestore.rules with the new logic above and deploy them (firebase deploy --only firestore:rules).

Build Frontend Components: Create the ManageHouseholdModal.jsx and its sub-components.

Update API Module: In a householdApi.js file, write the client-side functions that perform the Firestore update operations for joining and leaving households.

Build the Join Page: Create the JoinPage.jsx at the route /join/:householdId to handle the user flow for accepting an invite.

Implement Global State for Active Household: Ensure your AuthContext or other state management solution can store and manage which household is currently active. All feature pages must use this active ID for their queries.

Update Navigation: Add the "Manage Household" button to your main dashboard page.
